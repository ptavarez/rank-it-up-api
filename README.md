# Rank It Up Backend

Hello githubber! This repo contains the code I used to build the backend of my first fullstack application, Rank It Up: A Standings Generating Application. Rank It Up allows users to create players or teams. Once a player or team is created, users are able to face them off against each other in a match. Within a match, they will determine the outcome and choose a winner, loser, or decide if it's a draw. The application will keep record of each player's or team's wins and losses to make a standing table. This table will rank the player/team with the most wins and/or losses.

## Overview

## Entity Relationship Diagram

An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a data modeling technique that graphically illustrates an information systemâ€™s entities and the relationships between those entities. An ERD is a conceptual and representational model of data used to represent the entity framework infrastructure.

For my application, a User has many Players, and a Player has many matches. Checkout the ERD I came up with for this project:
